# SONAR Signal Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves classifying SONAR signals to distinguish between objects such as rocks and mines. The aim is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can analyze SONAR signal patterns and provide accurate predictions, contributing to fields like underwater exploration and defense.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing SONAR signal data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Analyzed and selected features to enhance classification accuracy.
- **Model Selection**: Compared multiple machine learning models to find the best classifier.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset contains SONAR signal readings that include:
- **60 Frequency-Based Attributes**: Amplitude measurements of sonar signals.
- **Target Labels**: Indicates whether the object is a rock (`R`) or a mine (`M`).

**Dataset Path:** Refer to the `SONAR.ipynb` file for data source and preprocessing steps.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Seaborn  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook
